For a long time, the data in our excel database has been written arbitrarily, such that to define the same thing (to make this clear, for example in my case, is for defining client names) would have many different spelling, for example, for \"github\", there might be 4 or more different variations, ranging from \"git hub\", \"Git Hub\", \"Github\", to \"GITHUB\". \n","\n","Now that my firm is planning to migrate our database into a database system which could avoid the problem, we still need to clean the previous datas which was written incorrectly. \n","\n","This is when the frustration to make all these variations into one single name using ctrl+F (find) and ctrl+R (replace) in excel comes in. You don't know how many variations there is. Even if you do, you will need to change all these variations one by one (i.e. change \"git hub\" into \"github\", \"Git Hub\" into \"github\", \"Github\" into \"github\", if \"github\" is the final name you want). \n","\n","Any of you have the similar problem? If so, here I provide blocks of codes which I write and use for cleaning my database in my firm, hopefully can be useful for others too. Using this code, we can change \"git hub\", \"Git Hub\", \"Github\", and \"GITHUB\" altogether into \"github\" all at once. I believe there is a lot of room for improvement, but since this is for my personal use, I did not make it too sophisticated. You can change some parts of this code to adjust with your case or to make it into an even better program!
